# TypeScript Node.js Nodemon Server Launch

This repository provides a foundational setup for launching a **[`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) server** using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for automatic server restarts during development. Build scalable and efficient server-side applications with ease!

## Features:
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Leveraging TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Nodemon Integration**: Seamless integration of Nodemon for automatic server restarts upon file changes, enhancing development efficiency.
- **Express Framework**: Utilizing the Express.js framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customizable configurations to suit your project requirements.

## Getting Started:
Follow these simple steps to kickstart your TypeScript Node.js server:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Customize your server configurations in `src/config` according to your project needs.
4. Start the server using `npm run dev` for development with Nodemon or `npm start` for production.
5. Begin coding your Node.js application and witness automatic server restarts in action with Nodemon!

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the main directory with the following configuration (edit it according to your configuration):
```.env
PORT="8081"
```
